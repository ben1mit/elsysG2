This is a project made for the subject \char`\"{}electronic system design, project I\+I\char`\"{} at N\+T\+NU. ~\newline
The project consists of two units\+: ~\newline
One which detects bird-\/collisions at the blade of the windmill, based on vibration patterns detected with an accelerometer, and sends a signal via Blluetooth Low Energy ~\newline
And a second, called the hub, which relays a signal recieved via B\+LE to our database via W\+I\+FI. ~\newline
 ~\newline
 The documentation for the unit on the wing is found in main\+\_\+project, and the code for the hub is found in hub\+\_\+project ~\newline
To understand the project, look at the documentation of the header-\/files and main-\/files in these projects first ~\newline
 ~\newline
 To run this project a few things must be done\+: ~\newline
download E\+S\+P-\/\+I\+DF, this can be done from here\+: \href{https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/}{\texttt{ https\+://docs.\+espressif.\+com/projects/esp-\/idf/en/latest/esp32/get-\/started/}}. (Building and flashing the project is also decribed there) ~\newline
 ~\newline
 You must also edit the file at esp-\/idf/components/partition\+\_\+table/partitions\+\_\+singleapp.\+csv, here \char`\"{}factory, app\char`\"{} size should be 0x180000 not 1M. ~\newline
 ~\newline
 Menuconfig must be set up correctly\+: ~\newline
-\/menuconfig on hub\+\_\+project\+: ~\newline
menuconfig -\/$>$ example connection configuration, write name and password of the wifi network, also check that connect using wifi is set here, and not connect using ethernet ~\newline
menuconfig -\/$>$ component config -\/$>$ bluetooth -\/$>$ check the box (otherwise the project wont compile) ~\newline
menuconfig -\/$>$ component config -\/$>$ E\+S\+P32-\/specific -\/$>$ main X\+T\+AL frequency -\/$>$ select autodetect ~\newline
